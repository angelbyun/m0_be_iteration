# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

The video that was posted was extremely helpful. Amy was able to breakdown the basics of the each method in a way that made sense. I understand that do and end are both necessary in the each method in order for the method to work.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

When I was doing challenge 2, I struggled to figure out exactly how to get the words with just 3 letters listed. I did do outside research on the each method and could not find too much information on it. However, I was happy to use the .length code to at least give me a false/true answer. I did post my video and reach out to the team to see if they had found the answers to walk me through.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

With all of the different methods we have learned today, I would like to get more comfortable in applying them. One thing that has made me feel confident is that if there is something that I am learning on my own and do not feel confident in it, usually after I get help from my instructor or peers, I have a much better grasp on it (i.e. when I was intimidated by Git a couple of days ago, I am now much more confident in it)

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I would love to know more about the each method and it is something I do hope the instructor covers tomorrow.
